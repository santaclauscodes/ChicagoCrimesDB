For a database class, we were encouraged to use various approaches to creat a live map of 
Chicago Crimes based on live information at the City of Chicago's police database.

The purpose of the exercise was to create graphs and various SQL queries to parse out different types
of crimes that could be displayed in different tables and reports and then integrated into Google Maps.

I wanted to upload the full jupiter Notebook which includes the generated graphics, but github has a 100 mb 
size limit that makes it impossible to upload using standard tools.

I have upload the source code for the assignment here in this repos, but have the full assignment code back on
my Google Drive.
